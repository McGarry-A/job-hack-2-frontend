Recreation of my CodeNation final project to see what improvements that I can make to the application.

To Do List:

HomePage:
> Render Cards DONE
> Pull Data from API DONE
> Pagination DONE
> Cards Clickable - show modal with details > add to apply list
> Link search to results
> Skeleton while homepage cards are loading
> Mask on the hero image on the homepage to make it darker

ContactPage:
> Build page DONE
> Build form DONE
> Error handling in form DONE
> Modal that feedsback when you submit Email
> Email JS to personal email when someone fills the form

Register:
> Build Register page DONE
> Toggle Login/Register DONE
> Error handling in form DONE
> Sign In With Email (Typescript backend?) DONE
> Sign In With Google (Firebase?)
> Append state object to global state
> Find a better image for the sign in component
> Remember me box, if they check it their user comp should be saved to local storage

App: 
> Need global state to handle the user obj
> Users should have a job-list
> There should be some sort of indication of the current user who is logged in
> They should be able to edit their information
> They should be able to log-out 


Bonus: 
> Find a better API with more information than Adzuna
