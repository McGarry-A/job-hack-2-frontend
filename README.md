Recreation of my CodeNation final project to see what improvements that I can make to the application.

To Do List:

HomePage:
> Render Cards DONE
> Pull Data from API DONE
> Pagination DONE
> Link search to results DONE
> Cards Clickable - show modal with details > add to apply list DONE
> Skeleton while homepage cards are loading DONE (BASIC LOADER ADDED)
> Mask on the hero image on the homepage to make it darker
> WHAT CAN WE REPLACE THE APPLE LOGO ON EACH CARD WITH >.<

ContactPage:
> Build page DONE
> Build form DONE
> Error handling in form DONE
> Modal that feedsback when you submit Email DONE
> Email JS to personal email when someone fills the form

Register:
> Build Register page DONE
> Toggle Login/Register DONE
> Error handling in form DONE
> Sign In With Email (Typescript backend?) DONE
> Sign In With Google (Firebase?)
> Append state object to global state DONE
> Find a better image for the sign in component
> Remember me box, if they check it their user comp should be saved to local storage

App: 
> Need global state to handle the user obj DONE
> There should be some sort of indication of the current user who is logged in DONE
> They should be able to log-out DONE 
> Users should have a job-list 
> They should be able to edit their information
> Error and Success notifications
> ALL BASIC CRUD FUNCTIONS DONE YET?
    > LOGIN DONE
    > SIGN IN
    > UPDATE ACCOUNT
    > DELETE ACCOUNT
    > LOGOUT DONE 

Animations: 
> Animate cards on the homepage
> Animate different routes

UI:
> Register redirects to the homepage
> Logout redirects to the homepage
> NEED TO MAKE THE APP RESPONSIVE.

MyJobs: 
> Drag and drop system to manage current jobs
> Can remove items from Job list
>

Food4Thought:
> Search button on homepage is useless as it searches on change of state
> Options look bad when they are ticked
> Entry animation for the homepage?
> Timeout that automatically closes notifications?
> Make the response object we get include link and conform to both REED AND ADZUNA 
> Are there any other good API'S that we can use? up 2 4 options would be good...


Bonus: 
> Find a better API with more information than Adzuna
> Animations
> Should give the user the option to choose between Adzuna and ReedAPI
